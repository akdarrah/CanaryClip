## CanaryClip Platform

CanaryClip is a new platform to publish Minecraft Builds (Schematics) Online. It supports automatic image rendering (using Chunky) so that people can see the front, back, left, and right sides of your build. The website can be found here: http://canaryclip.com/

CanaryClip users are able to see everything about a build including:
* Automatically rendered images
* The Build’s dimensions
* Minecraft blocks used in the build
* How many people viewed, favorited, and downloaded the build
* The Minecraft server was the build uploaded from

In addition to all this, every build is automatically given a download short code where other people can easily download the build to any Minecraft server running CanaryClip Bukkit Mod.

You can see examples of what some builds look like on this page: http://canaryclip.com/builds

## Bukkit Plugin Overview

The CanaryClip Minecraft mod is built on top of WorldEdit. It allows you to upload and download builds to/from CanaryClip.com without leaving Minecraft.

If you’ve ever used WorldEdit, you’ll be uploading your builds in no time!

To Upload your build:

1. Build something amazing!
2. Select your build using WorldEdit (//wand)
3. Use `//copy` to copy the blocks to your clipboard
4. Use `//can up` to upload the build to CanaryClip (You will be given a shortcode after uploading your build. The build will be immediately available for others to download, but may take a few minutes to show up on the website while the build is rendered)

To Download a build:

1. Find something awesome from CanaryClip, such as http://canaryclip.com/builds/bRjMZDy
2. Use the command `//can down bRjMZDy` to download to your clipboard
3. Use `//paste` to paste into the Minecraft world

Create an account on CanaryClip.com in order to download the Bukkit Plugin and Register your server. IMPORTANT: The CanaryClip mod will not work on your server unless you register your server with CanaryClip.

**Note:** This project has many dependencies from other Bukkit/Minecraft Projects. Full credit is on my about page: http://canaryclip.com/about
